Sarah Chan, at age 22, was hired into an entry-level actuarial position in 2012 with a starting salary of $50,000. She has been successful at passing actuarial exams and she expects to earn $100,000 by 2017 when she’ll get her fellowship. Her salary is expected to increase by 3% per year starting in 2018, all the way until she retires at age 65.  Outside of work, she as a 30 year fixed mortgage that she pays $18,000 per year. She started paying her mortgage in 2012. She also has student loan debt that she will pay off in 2021. Both the mortgage and the student loan debt payments are steady through the life of the loan. She does save $100 per month into her retirement fund; Sarah does not expect to increase her contribution (i.e. steady $100 per month until she retires). Sarah has other expenses like various insurance, living expenses, and other expenses. Whatever money she has left over annual, she puts into her Personal Savings Account that earns 1% interest and that rate is not expected to change until she retires.  VBA Task: The Excel financial model has already been created to project Sarah Chan’s Net Income and Personal Savings Account when she retires at age 65.
